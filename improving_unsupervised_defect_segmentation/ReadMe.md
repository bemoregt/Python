# Improving_Unsupervised_Defect_Segmentation

This is *Pytorch* implementation of the paper "Improving Unsupervised Defect Segmentation by Applying Structural Similarity to Autoencoders".
https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02011 

I used this for a comparative analysis with my novel approach to anomaly detection.

This is an amazing method for unsupervised defect segmentation using AutoEncoder with SSIM. 

# 1. Usage
*Install Library*
`Pytorch >= 1.0`<b> 
`scikit-learn` <b>
`PIL` <b>
`matplotlib`<b>
`numpy`<b>
  `os`<b>


# 2. Use SSIM
The structural similarity (SSIM) index is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic picturese.
It tries to exploit the interdependence between the images while calculating the similarity.

If you use SSIM method, you have to pip install SSIM-PIL.
