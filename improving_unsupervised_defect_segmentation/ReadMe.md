This is Pytorch implementation of the paper "Improving Unsupervised Defect Segmentation by Applying Structural Similarity to Autoencoders".
https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02011 

I used this for a comparative analysis with my novel approach to anomaly detection
That's is amazing method for unsupervised defect segmentation using AutoEncoder with SSIM. 

#1. Usage
0. Install Library
Pytorch >= 1.0 
scikit-learn 
PIL 
matplotlib
numpy
os


#2. Use SSIM
The structural similarity (SSIM) index is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic picturese.
It tries to exploit the interdependence between the images while calculating the similarity.

If you use SSIM method, you have to pip install SSIM-PIL.
